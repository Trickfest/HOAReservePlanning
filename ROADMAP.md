# ROADMAP

Backlog for features, improvements, research, fixes, etc. 

### Documentation

* Add some of the documentation currently in the readme to the spreadsheet as well. The spreadsheet should, in general, be self-contained.

### Features

* Charts

* Add ability to specify an alternative components file

* Add ability to specify an alternative inputs file

### Research

* Verify math manually

### Bugs

* In the spreadsheet, the contributions column is in a different color. It probably shouldn't be.

* On the inputs tab in the spreadsheet, the boolean flags should be right-justified.
