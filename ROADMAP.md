# ROADMAP

Backlog for features, improvements, research, fixes, etc. 

### Documentation

* Add some of the documentation currently in the readme to the spreadsheet as well. The spreadsheet should, in general, be self-contained.

### Features

* Add charts

### Research

* Test with Excel on Mac

* Test with Excel on iPad

* Test with Numbers on iPad

### Bugs

* In the spreadsheet, the contributions column is in a different color. It probably shouldn't be.  Or maybe it should.
